Installation
------------

**Normally:** If you *don't* use composer, don't worry - just include TwitterAPIExchange.php in your application. 

**Via Composer:** If you *do* use composer, here's what you add to your composer.json file to have yoson automatically 
imported into your vendor's folder:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "require": {
            "luismayta/yoson": "1.0.0"
        }
    }

Of course, you'll then need to 

run::

    php composer.phar update


**module.config.php**

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    return array(
    );
